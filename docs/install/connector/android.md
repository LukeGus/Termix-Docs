# Android Installation

[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/LukeGus/Termix-Mobile)

## GitHub Releases

Currently, I do not have a way to publish apps on the official Google Play Store, so you will have to manually install it and update by re-installing it completely.

Please download the `.apk` file from the [latest release](https://github.com/LukeGus/Termix-Mobile/releases). You must be logged into GitHub to download it. Once in GitHubm, click on the blue link in the latest release that looks like the image below to download:

To those of you who already know how to install APK's, the installation is exactly what you would expect. For those of you who don't, please follow this [guide](https://www.lifewire.com/install-apk-on-android-4177185).

Once installed and opened, follow the on-screen guide to connect to your existing Termix instance.
