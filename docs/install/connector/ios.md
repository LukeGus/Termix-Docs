# iOS Installation

[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/Termix-SSH/Mobile)

## Installation Methods

### Apple App Store (Recommended)

Using your Apple device, visit [this link](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/termix-ssh-companion/id6752672071) or search `Termix - SSH Companion` on the Apple App Store. You can install and open it like you would any other app via the App Store.

Once installed and opened, follow the on-screen guide to connect to your existing Termix instance. If you enjoy the app, consider leaving an honest review so the app shows up higher in the search results.

### GitHub Releases

Click on [this link](https://github.com/Termix-SSH/Mobile/releases/latest/download/termix_ios.ipa) on your Apple device to download the latest version. To download a specific version, visit [GitHub releases](https://github.com/Termix-SSH/Mobile/releases).

You can then sideload the app as usual. I recommend you use [AltStore](https://faq.altstore.io/) for sideloading.

Once installed and opened, follow the on-screen guide to connect to your existing Termix instance.
