# iOS Installation

[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/LukeGus/Termix-Mobile)

## Official Apple App Store

This guide only works on iOS devices. iPadOS and macOS are planned to be supported in the future.

Using your iOS Apple mobile device, visit [this link](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/termix-ssh-companion/id6752672071) or search `Termix - SSH Companion` on the Apple App Store. You can install and open it like you would any other app via the App Store.

Once installed and opened, follow the on-screen guide to connect to your existing Termix instance. If you enjoy the app, consider leaving an honest review so the app shows up higher in the serach results.
