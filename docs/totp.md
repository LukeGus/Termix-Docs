# Two-Factor Authentication (TOTP) Setup Guide

## Overview

Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) adds an extra layer of security to your account by requiring both your password and a time-based one-time password (TOTP) generated by an authenticator app. This guide will walk you through setting up, managing, and using 2FA in Termix.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up 2FA, ensure you have:

- A smartphone or device with an authenticator app installed
- A local username and password account, TOTP cannot be used with OIDC.
