# Two-Factor Authentication (TOTP) Setup Guide

## Overview

Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) adds an extra layer of security to your account by requiring both your password and a time-based one-time password (TOTP) generated by an authenticator app. This guide will walk you through setting up, managing, and using 2FA in Termix.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up 2FA, ensure you have:

- A smartphone or device with an authenticator app installed
- A local username and password account, TOTP cannot be used with OIDC.

## Recommended Authenticator Apps

- **Google Authenticator** (iOS/Android)
- **Microsoft Authenticator** (iOS/Android)
- **Authy** (iOS/Android/Desktop)
- **1Password** (iOS/Android/Desktop)
- **Bitwarden** (iOS/Android/Desktop)

## Setting Up Two-Factor Authentication

### Step 1: Initiate Setup

1. Navigate to your **Profile & Security** section
2. Click on the **Security** tab
3. Click **"Enable Two-Factor Authentication"**

### Step 2: Scan QR Code

1. Termix will display a QR code
2. Open your authenticator app and scan the QR code
3. Alternatively, you can manually enter the secret key shown below the QR code

### Step 3: Verify Setup

1. Your authenticator app will generate a 6-digit code
2. Enter this code in the verification field
3. Click **"Verify and Enable"**

### Step 4: Save Backup Codes

1. After successful verification, you'll receive backup codes
2. Download or copy these codes
3. Each backup code can only be used once
4. Click **"Complete Setup"** to finish

## Using Two-Factor Authentication

### Daily Login

1. Enter your username and password as usual
2. When prompted, open your authenticator app
3. Enter the 6-digit code displayed in your app

### Code Generation
