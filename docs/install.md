# Installation

Choose the installation method that works best for your platform and use case.

## Server

For running the required Termix backend and web app front end:

- **[Docker Installation](./install/server/docker)** - The simplest way to get Termix server up and running with Docker.
- **[Manual Compilation](./install/server/manual-compile)** - Build and compile Termix from source code for custom deployments.

## Connector

For running Termix as a client/connector application that connects to the server (requires one of the above server installations to be running):

- **[Windows](./install/connector/windows)** - Download pre-compiled binaries for Windows systems.
- **[Linux](./install/connector/linux)** - Download pre-compiled binaries for Linux systems.
- **[Mobile](./install/connector/mobile/)** - Mobile applications for Termix are currently under development.
