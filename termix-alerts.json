    "message": "We’re excited to announce the beta release of the Termix desktop app for Windows and Linux! This version provides the same features as the web-version Termix and connects directly to your existing Termix Docker container.\n\nYou can choose between:\n- Automatic setup – for a quick installation\n- Portable version – no installation required\n\n Note: This is still under development. Future updates will allow running Termix without a Docker container.\n\nNext up: we’re working on a mobile app and adding many new features to make Termix even more powerful.",
